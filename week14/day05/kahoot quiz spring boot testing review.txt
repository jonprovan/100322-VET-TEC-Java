Kahoot Review

1. Remember we have to import Junit4 ourselves if we want it along with spring-starter-test

2. WebMvcMock does not spin up the embedded server, it just simulates sending requests.

3. Mockito.when(myClass.myMethod(any())).thenReturn("") 
or 
                                        .thenThrow(new Exception());

4. @SpringBootTest actually loads the full context and spins up our whole app so it does a lot more for us than WebMvcMock which is great unless we want to only test a slice of the application then it is wasteful and slow

5. Yes, Patrick is teaching cloud next week

TODO 
- Spring Security example project
- 2-3pm group work on Spring Boot shop example tests 
(finish controller and service layer or play around with repository layer testing)
